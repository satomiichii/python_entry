# Day 16 : Coffee Machine in OOP

Re-create the coffee machine function by using pre-written Classes.

Class documentation: https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTragRHILyj76AvVgpWeOlEaLBXoxPM_43SdEyffIKtOgarj42SoSAsK6LwLAdHQs2qFLGthRZds6ok/pub

## My Solution

## Today's Takeaway

- object = instance
- Pascal case is for the name of Class in Python
- Object is not dictionary like JavaScript instance is always object.
- Object in Python has properties called 'Attribute' and can be accessed by using dot notation.
  object.attribute
- self = this
