## Today's Takeaway

- str.title(), str.captalize() both return title cased string.
- There are so many string method that looks really useful and make things easire.
- Docstring is the way to add your own explanation to a function. The explanation will pop when you try to call the function as a pop-up window.(Make sure that your code editor's code intelligence setting is activated.)
