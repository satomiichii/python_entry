## Today's takeaway

- indentation MATTERS! python excute line of code based on the indentation in side of the conditional stattement.
- elif = else if
- and = &&
- or = ||
- not = !
- .lower() = .toLowerCase()
- .count('char') > return number of the char in the string that you are calling the method on.
