# Day 31 : Flash Card

Create a GUI flash card app using Tkinter
implement following functionalities.

- User can see a French word on the flash card
- After 3 second, the card flips and show the English word that corresponding the French word
- If user already remember the word, user can click the check button, so that the word is removed from the word list
- If user is still not sure about the word, user can click the cross button to move on to a next word, while the word is still remaining in the word list 
- The list of the remaining words is saved as a csv file
- If user has the csv that stores remaining words, the app restores tha data from the file when use run the app next time
- If use doesn't have the remaining words csv, the app restores the data from the original words csv

## My Solution

## Today's Takeaway
- This is a capstone project for concreting concepts like Tkinter, pandas, file manipulation, error handling etc.
- Python doesn't have a concept of hoisting? I have to look up for that
