# Day2: Tip Calculator

1. If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip.

2. Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) \* 1.12 = 33.6

3. Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.ðŸ’ª

## Today's takeaway

- Python has more datatype for number.
  ex. int, float, complex
- inside of your code, you can use \_ to seperate intefer into 3 digit 12_233.22 = 12,333.22
- type() = typeof
- Python doesn't concat string with number for us.
- We should use f string to concat these 2 types.
- f'string {num or variable}' = `string ${num or variable}`
- Division returns floating number as a result
- Use // 'floor division' to get integer as a result
