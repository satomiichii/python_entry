## Today's Takeaway

- def function_name () = function functionName ()
- Python makes you to use 4 space for the indentation
- https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#indentation
- while condition: = while (condition) {}
- To invoke a function, you can simply type the name of the function and () following. same as JavaScript.
