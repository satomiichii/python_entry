- The password field can be filled with manual input
- When user click the 'Generate password' button, the 'password' field will be filled with auto generated password that satisfy all the requirements. Also the generated password will be copied on the clip board
- When user click the 'Add' button, the value of the 3 input area will be stored in the text file.
