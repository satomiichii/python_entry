## Today's Takeaway

- `'elm' in 'list/str'` / `'elm' not in 'list/str'` > check if the elm is in the list and return boolean. Useful for making if conditions.
- I've had syntax error on vscode when I use f-string inside of my code. I changed my python interpreter ver. to 3.9.1 and the problem resolved.
- When you import multiple valuable from a module, like 'import a_module' you have to use .notation to access the variable inside of the module.
  ex. a_module.variable
- If you use the syntax `'from a_module import *'`, all the variables became accessible by just typing the name. no .notation needed.
